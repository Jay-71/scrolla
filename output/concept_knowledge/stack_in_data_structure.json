      "type": "Principle",
      "knowledge": {
        "summary": "Last In, First Out (LIFO) is a principle used in data structures to manage the ordering of elements. It prioritizes the most recent addition as the first one to be removed.",
        "key_points": [
          "Elements are added and removed from only one end of the structure.",
          "This principle is often used in stacks, queues, and certain types of algorithms.",
          "In a stack, the last element pushed becomes the first one popped."
        ],
        "common_confusion": "It's important to remember that LIFO means the most recent addition comes out first, not the oldest as in FIFO (First In, First Out) structures like queues."

      "type": "Operation",

        "summary": "Adding an element onto the top of a stack. The size of the stack increases by one after a push operation.",
        "key_points": [
          "It adds an element to the top of the stack.",
          "The top of the stack is where the most recently added element resides."

      "concept": "Pop Operation",
      "type": "Operation",
      "knowledge": {
        "summary": "The Pop operation removes the topmost element from a stack.",
        "key_points": [
          "It reduces the size of the stack by one.",
          "The removed element is usually returned as the result of the operation.",
          "If the stack is empty, attempting to pop will cause an error."

      "type": "Operation",
      "knowledge": {
        "summary": "The Peek operation allows you to view the top element of a stack without removing it.",
        "key_points": [
          "It's a read-only operation that gives information about the next item to be processed.",
          "This is useful when you want to check the stack's top element before performing any actions.",
          "However, it does not alter the stack."
        ],
        "common_confusion": "One common beginner mistake is to assume that peeking and popping are the same operations. Peek only looks at the top of the stack, while pop removes it."

        "key_points": [
          "Recursive functions or methods should have a base case to prevent infinite loops and stack overflows",
          "Exceeding the maximum function call depth leads to a 'Maximum recursion depth exceeded' error",
