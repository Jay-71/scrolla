  "raw_text": "This is a list of well-known data structures. For a wider list of terms, see list of terms relating to algorithms and data structures. For a comparison of running times for a subset of this list see comparison of data structures.\nBoolean, true or false.\nCharacter\nFloating-point representation of a finite subset of the rationals.\nIncluding single-precision and double-precision IEEE 754 floats, among others\nFixed-point representation of the rationals\nInteger, a direct representation of either the integers or the non-negative integers\nReference, sometimes erroneously referred to as a pointer or handle, is a value that refers to another value, possibly including itself\nSymbol, a unique identifier\nEnumerated type, a set of symbols\nComplex, representation of complex numbers\nArray, a sequence of elements of the same type stored contiguously in memory\nRecord (also called a structure or struct), a collection of fields\nProduct type (also called a tuple), a record in which the fields are not named\nString, a sequence of characters representing text\nUnion, a datum which may be one of a set of types\nTagged union (also called a variant, discriminated union or sum type), a union with a tag specifying which type the data is\nContainer\nList\nTuple\nAssociative array, Map\nMultimap\nSet\nMultiset (bag)\nStack\nQueue (example Priority queue)\nDouble-ended queue\nGraph (example Tree, Heap)\nSome properties of abstract data types:\n\"Ordered\" means that the elements of the data type have some kind of explicit order to them, where an element can be considered \"before\" or \"after\" another element. This order is usually determined by the order in which the elements are added to the structure, but the elements can be rearranged in some contexts, such as sorting a list. For a structure that isn't ordered, on the other hand, no assumptions can be made about the ordering of the elements (although a physical implementation of these data types will often apply some kind of arbitrary ordering). \"Uniqueness\" means that duplicate elements are not allowed. Depending on the implementation of the data type, attempting to add a duplicate element may either be ignored, overwrite the existing element, or raise an error. The detection for duplicates is based on some inbuilt (or alternatively, user-defined) rule for comparing elements.\nA data structure is said to be linear if its elements form a sequence.\nArray\nAssociative array\nBit array\nBit field\nBitboard\nBitmap\nCircular buffer\nControl table\nImage\nDope vector\nDynamic array\nGap buffer\nHashed array tree\nLookup table\nMatrix\nParallel array\nSorted array\nSparse matrix\nIliffe vector\nVariable-length array\nDoubly linked list\nArray list\nLinked list also known as a Singly linked list\nAssociation list\nSelf-organizing list\nSkip list\nUnrolled linked list\nVList\nConc-tree list\nXor linked list\nZipper\nDoubly connected edge list also known as half-edge\nDifference list\nFree list\nTrees are a subset of directed acyclic graphs.\nAA tree\nAVL tree\nBinary search tree\nBinary tree\nCartesian tree\nConc-tree list\nLeft-child right-sibling binary tree\nOrder statistic tree\nPagoda\nRandomized binary search tree\nRed\u2013black tree\nRope\nScapegoat tree\nSelf-balancing binary search tree\nSplay tree\nT-tree\nTango tree\nThreaded binary tree\nTop tree\nTreap\nWAVL tree\nWeight-balanced tree\nZip tree\nB-tree\nB+ tree\nB*-tree\nDancing tree\n2\u20133 tree\n2\u20133\u20134 tree\nQueap\nFusion tree\nBx-tree\nHeap\nMin-max heap\nBinary heap\nB-heap\nWeak heap\nBinomial heap\nFibonacci heap\nAF-heap\nLeonardo heap\n2\u20133 heap\nSoft heap\nPairing heap\nLeftist heap\nTreap\nBeap\nSkew heap\nTernary heap\nD-ary heap\nBrodal queue\nIn these data structures each tree node compares a bit slice of key values.\nRadix tree\nSuffix tree\nSuffix array\nCompressed suffix array\nFM-index\nGeneralised suffix tree\nB-tree\nJudy array\nTrie\nX-fast trie\nY-fast trie\nMerkle tree\nTernary search tree\nTernary tree\nK-ary tree\nAnd\u2013or tree\n(a,b)-tree\nLink/cut tree\nSPQR-tree\nSpaghetti stack\nDisjoint-set data structure (Union-find data structure)\nFusion tree\nEnfilade\nExponential tree\nFenwick tree\nVan Emde Boas tree\nRose tree\nThese are data structures used for space partitioning or binary space partitioning.\nSegment tree\nInterval tree\nRange tree\nBin\nK-d tree\nImplicit k-d tree\nMin/max k-d tree\nRelaxed k-d tree\nAdaptive k-d tree\nQuadtree\nOctree\nLinear octree\nZ-order\nUB-tree\nR-tree\nR+ tree\nR* tree\nHilbert R-tree\nX-tree\nMetric tree\nCover tree\nM-tree\nVP-tree\nBK-tree\nBounding interval hierarchy\nBounding volume hierarchy\nBSP tree\nRapidly exploring random tree\nAbstract syntax tree\nParse tree\nDecision tree\nAlternating decision tree\nMinimax tree\nExpectiminimax tree\nFinger tree\nExpression tree\nLog-structured merge-tree\nPQ tree\nApproximate Membership Query Filter\nBloom filter\nCuckoo filter\nQuotient filter\nCount\u2013min sketch\nDistributed hash table\nDouble hashing\nDynamic perfect hash table\nHash array mapped trie\nHash list\nHash table\nHash tree\nHash trie\nKoorde\nPrefix hash tree\nRolling hash\nMinHash\nCtrie\nMany graph-based data structures are used in computer science and related fields:\nGraph\nAdjacency list\nAdjacency matrix\nGraph-structured stack\nScene graph\nDecision tree\nBinary decision diagram\nZero-suppressed decision diagram\nAnd-inverter graph\nDirected graph\nDirected acyclic graph\nPropositional directed acyclic graph\nMultigraph\nHypergraph\nLightmap\nWinged edge\nQuad-edge\nRouting table\nSymbol table\nPiece table\nE-graph\nList of algorithms\nPurely functional data structure\nBlockchain, a hash-based chained data structure that can persist state history over time\nTommy Benchmarks Comparison of several data structures."
